__How to hack:__

Check what web socket messages we receive when _wsd_ shuts down in the backend
and handle it appropriately in the admin websocket. One can check the
websocket handling for the documents in _src/core/Socket.js_ and do something
similar with the admin websocket. Code for admin websocket is in
_loleaflet/src/admin/_

In debug mode, it would be nice to have incoming and outgoing `postMessage` contents written into browser console.
